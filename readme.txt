                      LATEX PROJECT FOR DRAWING GRAPHS
In linux:just run python program
--> python3 main.py

***As we used python language for making tex file of desired graph and  also for running it.***

#After running python programme, 
       --> which one of the graph you want to draw just enter your choice
       --> If you want to give adjacency matrix then make a file
           for example:if you want to give 3*3 matrix:
                        1 2 3
                        4 5 6
                        7 8 9 
           -- Entries must be single char(a-zA-Z) or integer(0-9) or empty 
-->For Undirected graph, just give no. of vertices 
-->for Directed graph,in case of given no. of vertices,it will make complete graph  
-->  NO DATABASE REQUIRED
--> pdf of  your desired graph will be displayed.
